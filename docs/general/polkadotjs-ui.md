The Polkadot-JS UI is the native application for accessing to all features available on Substrate
chains such as Polkadot and Kusama. The UI is one of the moving parts of
[**Polkadot-JS**](./polkadotjs.md), and its functionalities go beyond normal wallet functionalities
such as transfers.

## Main Functionalities

### Accounts

In this section of the UI you can see accounts injected from a browser extension such as the
Polkadot-JS Extension or .

### Network

Staking menu is divided into eight tabs:

  for staking, bonded amount, and nominations. In this tab you can do staking-related transactions
  such as bonding more funds or changing nominations.
- The **Payouts** (visible only if you added an account) tab shows any pending rewards that still
  need to paid out to you.
- The **Pool** tab shows all registered [**nomination pool**](../learn/learn-nomination-pools.md)
  with respective state (open, blocked or destroying). This tab can be also used to create and join
