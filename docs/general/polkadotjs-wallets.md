## The Polkadot-JS Browser Extension

The Polkadot-JS Browser Extension is a tool under the [Polkadot-JS](./polkadotjs.md) umbrella. The
extension is not a wallet _per se_ but more an account management tool. It allows you to create
accounts and import accounts from [Ledger](./ledger.md) devices or Parity Signer. It also allows you
restore lost accounts. The extension does not allow you to transact or do anything else other than
adding accounts.

The benefit of having your accounts in the extension is that if you clear the cache of your browser,
your accounts will be kept. This does not happen if you added an account to the Polkadot-JS UI (see
next Section). Also, the extension recognizes websites that have been flagged for malicious
activity. Another security note, the extension will always ask you of you want a specific website to
access account information in it.
